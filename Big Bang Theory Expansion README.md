Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game (Big Bang Theory Expansion)

ðŸŽ® Project Purpose

Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game, inspired by the Big Bang Theory! This game expands the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game by introducing two additional choices: Lizard and Spock. The game is designed to be fun and a little quirky, just like the iconic TV show, while also giving players more strategic choices to engage with.

In this project, you can play against a computer opponent, choosing from five options: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock. Each option has a set of interactions where one can defeat another, similar to the classic game but with a fresh twist! The rules of the game follow the logic made famous by Sheldon Cooper and friends.

ðŸŒŸ Game Features:

-Expanded choices: Five options (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock).
-Play against the computer: Select your choice and face off against a random computer selection.
-Visual ASCII representation: See each choice displayed in its own artistic style using ASCII art.
-Big Bang Theory theme: Inspired by the famous TV series, adding fun references and terminology to the gameplay.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
-Python: The game is written in Python, utilizing basic programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, and user input.
-Random module: For generating a random choice for the computer's move.
-ASCII Art: Visual representations of each game choice using simple text characters to display the options graphically.

ðŸ“ˆ Impact
-Fun & Engaging: By playing this game, players can enjoy a lighthearted, competitive game with more variety than the traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors.
